# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this study guide to summarize the information that I learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git in the Prework Course. I will be able to utilize this study guide to help me remember key points from each of the topics. It also helped me understand the content by putting it into practice while building this application.

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
